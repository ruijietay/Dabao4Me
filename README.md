# Dabao4Me
Dabao4Me is a service that connects hungry individuals - think crowdsource food delivery. Dabao4Me aims to solve the pain points present within current food delivery systems like Grab and Foodpanda. By connecting users as either Requesters (the person who requests for food) and Fulfillers (the person who buys the food), we eliminate the problem of the shortage of delivery riders, and the high delivery prices we so commonly see.
